## STEP 6: Add a field “position” to all items in the array via javascript “map” function, the value must be “developer”

1. Create a map function
    - `map` function means it creats new array by applying a transformation function to each element in the original array

2. Use the spread operator
    - `...item` means that all of the properties of item are copied into the new object

3. Add a new field
    - `item.position = "devloper"` add a new field with the "value" developer

4. Return the data
    - `return data` returns the updated data array to be used in subsequent operations
